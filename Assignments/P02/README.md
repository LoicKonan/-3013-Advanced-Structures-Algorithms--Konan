## Program 2 - Processing in Linear Time

### Loic Konan

#### Description

This program read in a dictionary file from dict_w_defs.json and store it in a linked list.\
After the dictionary (linked list) is loaded, we are going to perform "autosuggestions" \ when a user types characters at the console.
Suggestions will start after 1 character is typed, however only the top 10 suggestions \ will be printed along with the total number of matching words (example output below).\
The time it takes to find each suggestion will be displayed in seconds.
