### Program 2 - Processing in Log Time

### Loic Konan

#### Description

This project is about loading a **Binary Search Tree** with dictionary words, then timing how long it takes to look them up. We want to compare this with how long it took to look items up in the **linked list** from last program. For now we will keep the same interface for the previous program.
